*A puzzle game programmed for a Gemix Studio contest.*

## Contest rules

First I would like to explain the rules of the contest. This was a typical secret voting for
the theme contest. The theme choosen was that the input of the game should control more than
one entity at the same time.

## Game description

What I decided to do given the theme was a puzzle game where you move the player through a
2D cell world using the arrows. But the level is plagued of bombs with arrows on them. When
you press an arrow to move the player, all the bombs with that arrow explode in a bomberman
4-way fashion until they collide with some wall. Also, bombs survive the exploding episode,
the only way to destroy a bomb being with the explosion from another bomb. Add to the mix the
fact that you can push bombs in a sokoban way and you have a neat original puzzle game.

There are 10 levels, of increasing complexity, so, good luck!
